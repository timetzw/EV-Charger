The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to a growing demand for convenient and reliable charging infrastructure. As cities around the world work to promote sustainable transportation, an important question that arises is how to optimally allocate EV chargers to meet the needs of EV drivers while also considering factors such as cost, social event impact, and spatial distribution. In this study, we focus on the city of Madison, Wisconsin and investigate the optimal allocation of EV chargers in the city. We aim to identify the most efficient and customer-satisfied allocations for EV chargers, taking into account factors such as charging price, distance to final destination and driver's own preferences. We built a simualtion model testing the design of two parking lots and limited number of chargers under different scenarios, and the optimal result shows a concentration behavior of the chargers. The result will provide valuable insights on pricing strategy for policymakers and city planners as they work to promote the adoption of EVs and support the transition to a more sustainable transportation system.
