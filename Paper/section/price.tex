In this section, we mainly discuss about the influence of the pricing strategy. We first discuss the situation under normal days, then discuss about the change of Game days, and how the pricing strategy can be adjusted to fit the situation. Our setup for this section is an even distribution of the chargers over all parking lots.

\subsection{Normal Day Situation}
If the price is controled to be equivalent, assume all other systems are turned off, then the driver only makes choice between two parking lots based on the distance. If all other criteria are the same, then they will make a random choice.
